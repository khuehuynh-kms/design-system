# PADI Design System

**PADI Design System** is tool for building PADI UI with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). It provides you and your team a set of organized tools, patterns & practices that work as the foundation for your application development.

The tool is built on top of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org), [Vue Styleguidist](https://github.com/vue-styleguidist/vue-styleguidist), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),  and is aimed for designers and front-end developers who have at least basic knowledge of component based workflows + HTML, PostCSS, SCSS & JavaScript.
